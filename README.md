# Syed MCP Registry

Syed MCP Registry is a local, isolated MCP registry that provides MCP clients with a list of MCP servers. This version is rebranded and restricted to only two local MCP servers, with all remote aggregation and fallback to public registries disabled.

## Project Status

**2025-12-05 update:**
- The registry is now fully local-only and rebranded as "Syed MCP Registry."
- Only two MCP servers are listed, as defined in `data/seed.json`.
- Remote aggregation and fallback to public registries are disabled at the code level.
- Docker Compose and database setup have been updated for a clean, isolated development environment.


## Quick Start


### Prerequisites

- **Docker**
- **Go 1.24.x**


#### Running the server

```bash
# Start the local Syed MCP Registry environment
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This starts the registry at [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) with PostgreSQL. The database uses ephemeral storage and is reset each time you restart the containers, ensuring a clean state for development and testing. The registry only loads the two MCP servers defined in `data/seed.json` and does not aggregate from any remote sources.

Configuration is managed via [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml). The default database name is now `mcp-registry-test` for a clean, isolated state.

```


### Authentication

Publishing supports multiple authentication methods:
- **GitHub OAuth**
- **GitHub OIDC**
- **DNS verification**
- **HTTP verification**

The registry validates namespace ownership when publishing. For example:
- To publish `ai.alpic.test/test-mcp-server`, you must prove ownership of the relevant namespace.
